        <h2>Welcome to Kitty Kingdom</h2>
        <p>Where all cats are royalty!</p>
        <p>Cats have a long history of association with humans, dating back thousands of years to ancient Egypt, where they were revered as sacred animals. Domestic cats are believed to have descended from the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), which was domesticated around 9,000 years ago. We are passionate cat lovers dedicated to promoting the well-being of all felines. </p>

            <b>Physical Characteristics:</b>
            <p>Cats come in various breeds, each with its own unique characteristics in terms of size, coat length, color, and pattern. They typically have a slender body, retractable claws, keen senses (especially sight and hearing), and a flexible spine, which allows for incredible agility and acrobatics.
            </p>      
            <b>Behavior: </b>
            <p>Cats are known for their independent and solitary nature, but they also form strong bonds with their human companions. They are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk, but they can adapt to various schedules. Cats exhibit a wide range of behaviors, including hunting, grooming, kneading (kneading with their paws), purring, and vocalizations such as meowing, purring, and hissing.
            </p> 
            <b>Habitat:</b>
            <p>Domestic cats can adapt to various environments, from urban apartments to rural farms. They are skilled hunters and have been introduced to many parts of the world, often becoming invasive species in some ecosystems.
            </p>
            <b> Health and Care:</b>
            <p>Proper nutrition, regular veterinary care, and a safe environment are essential for a cat's health and well-being. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet rich in animal protein. Commercial cat food or a balanced homemade diet can meet their nutritional needs. Regular grooming, including brushing their coat and trimming their nails, helps keep cats healthy and comfortable.
            </p>
            
            <b>Pop Culture and Symbolism:</b> 
          <p>           Cats have been featured prominently in art, literature, folklore, and popular culture throughout history. They are often associated with traits such as mystery, independence, curiosity, and agility. In many cultures, cats are considered symbols of good luck, guardianship, and wisdom.</p>
